🌱 Theme: “Green Intelligence: AI for a Sustainable Planet”
💡 Tagline: “Smarter Routes. Safer Cities. Greener Karnataka.”
🚨 PROBLEM STATEMENT

In cities like Mysuru and Bengaluru, thousands of commuters — especially students and professionals — depend on city buses every day.
But they face:

🚏 Long waiting hours with no idea where the bus is

⏱️ Unpredictable timings due to traffic

🚍 Buses running with expired pollution or fitness certificates

⚠️ No emergency SOS support for passengers

🌫️ Outdated, unoptimized routes that waste fuel and emit CO₂

This results in inefficiency, safety risks, and environmental damage.

It combines:

🧠 AI for real-time ETA & eco-routing

📍 GPS-based live bus tracking

🌱 Eco-dashboard with CO₂ and fuel analytics

🚨 SOS system for emergencies

💬 Chatbot for instant support

⚙️ Smart admin tools for compliance & analytics
