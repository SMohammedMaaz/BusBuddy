🧑‍✈️ Goal of the Driver Module

To give bus drivers a smart, easy-to-use mobile dashboard that handles:

Real-time GPS tracking

Document uploads & validation

Eco-driving insights

Automatic notifications for document expiry

Emergency SOS support

Full data sync with Admin dashboard

This ensures accountability, transparency, and eco-compliance — while making life easier for drivers.

⚙️ Driver App Login & Setup
🧩 During Sign Up / Login

Drivers must provide:

✅ Full Name

✅ Vehicle Number (Registration No.) — e.g., KA09 F 1234

✅ Driving License (DL) Number

✅ Bus Route (e.g., VVIET to City Bus Stand)

✅ Phone Number / Email

✅ Password / OTP Login

Once logged in:

Driver’s GPS location starts transmitting automatically (after permission granted).

The bus is linked to this driver using Vehicle Number.

Admin and passengers can now track that specific bus live.

🧾 Smart Documentation System (Eco-Compliance)
🧠 AI-Driven Doc Management

Drivers upload the following documents only once:

Pollution Under Control (PUC) Certificate

Fitness Certificate

Driving License (DL)

Vehicle Registration Certificate (RC)

🔐 What Happens Next:

Each document’s expiry date is extracted and stored in Firebase (or AI text reader like Google Vision API).

The system auto-calculates validity:

✅ Valid until...

⚠️ Expiring soon...

❌ Expired! Renewal Required.

Drivers get a notification reminder 15 days before expiry.

Admin receives alerts for expired certificates.

🧩 Example Data Model (Firestore)
{
  "vehicle_number": "KA09F1234",
  "driver_id": "UID001",
  "PUC_valid_till": "2026-03-12",
  "Fitness_valid_till": "2025-07-10",
  "DL_valid_till": "2027-05-15",
  "status": "Active"
}

📢 Notification Example

⚠️ “Dear Driver, your Fitness Certificate for Bus KA09 F 1234 will expire in 10 days. Please renew soon to stay eco-compliant.”

📡 GPS Integration (Auto-Tracking)

On driver login, app requests GPS permission.

Location updates are sent to Firebase Realtime Database every 5 seconds.

These coordinates are:

Used by passengers to see live bus movement.

Used by AI model for ETA prediction.

Visible on admin map dashboard.

Example:
{
  "vehicle_number": "KA09F1234",
  "location": {
    "lat": 12.2958,
    "lng": 76.6394
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-11-08T14:20:00Z"
}

🧠 Eco-Driving Insights (AI Feedback)

The driver panel includes an “Eco Insights” section:

Displays daily fuel usage.

AI feedback like:

“Avoid frequent braking.”

“You saved 1.3L fuel today by efficient driving.”

Shows Eco Score (0–100).

🗺️ Route Panel

Assigned route displayed with stops and ETA per stop.

Color-coded route progress bar:

🟢 On time

🟠 Slightly delayed

🔴 Late

Driver can tap:

🚦 “Start Trip” → activates GPS tracking

🏁 “End Trip” → stops tracking

🆘 SOS System for Drivers

Adapted from the GitHub repo (tony007-ux/hackthon
):

“SOS” button visible in driver’s app.

On click:

Sends driver’s current location + vehicle number to:

Admin Dashboard

Nearby Police Control Room API

Triggers visual alert in admin panel (“Bus KA09F1234 – Emergency Alert!”).

Option to call emergency helpline directly.

🧭 Replit Prompt (Final for DRIVER SYSTEM)

Enhance the BusBuddy system by building a Driver Module with the following:

Sign Up / Login that asks: Full Name, Vehicle Number, DL Number, Phone, Route.

GPS integration that shares driver’s live location every 5 seconds with Firebase.

Document upload (PUC, Fitness, DL, RC) stored in Firestore with expiry validation.

Notification system that auto-reminds driver 15 days before expiry.

Eco Insights dashboard showing fuel efficiency and AI driving tips.

Route Panel with start/end trip button and stop-wise ETA.

SOS button (based on GitHub repo logic) that sends emergency data (location, bus ID, driver ID) to Admin & Police APIs.

Ensure the UI is clean, responsive, glassmorphic, and eco-themed (green-blue gradient).

All data synced with Admin and visible on Passenger live map.

🧠 How It Connects

Passenger → Tracks driver’s live bus & ETA.

Driver → Sends GPS & document info.

Admin → Validates, monitors, and manages.

This ensures every bus, driver, and passenger is part of one smart connected ecosystem for Greener Karnataka 🌿.
